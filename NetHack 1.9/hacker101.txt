HOW TO BE A HACKER 101
1)DO NOT HACK FOR WRONG PURPOSES,ONLY ON PERMISSION!
	"With great power,comes great responsiblity"
						-Uncle Ben

2)Don't be a script kiddie,
	Script Kiddies are basically someone who download other people scripts and just say that they're a hacker,
	well typically yes,but they're ability are limited to the tool they download. Better to write your own codes
	and scripts,using kali linux tools like aircrack-ng does not make you a script kiddie ok:)

3)Make an alias like M3D4NG

4)Customize your cmd(Command Prompt)by right clicking on top of the window,select properties,color,then change
  Screen text to green and transparency to 70-80% like a linux terminal

that's it,best regards
